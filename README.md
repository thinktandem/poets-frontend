Poets Frontend
==============

https://travis-ci.com/thinktandem/poets-frontend.svg?branch=master

The `poets-frontend` app is a Nuxt JS app that consumes data from a Contenta CMS
Drupal backend.

Getting Started
---------------

The easiest way to get started developing the poets.org frontend magicks is by using [Lando](https://github.com/lando/lando), however if you are feeling pro and desire moar speedz you can also use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) straight up.

### 1. Using Lando

**This requires you have Lando 3.0.0-rc.14 or higher**.

Please note that because `nuxt` takes a bit to get going and `lando` only waits so long, your initial start *may* produce red URLs. If this happens we recommend you inspect the status of the start with `lando logs` or `docker logs poetsd8_[appserver|styleguide]_1` and then rerun `lando start` when both the `appserver` and `styleguide` have launched. This should result in green lights across the board.

```bash
# Do everything
lando start

# Lint the codes
lando yarn lint

# Run end to end tests
lando yarn test
```

#### Note About Memory Usage

Nuxt frequently uses an ungodly amount of memory when it's just doing its normal thing, and by default, Docker for Mac only gives the Docker VM 2GB of memory, which means that Node/Docker will frequently run out of memory while trying to compile the application. For maximum awesomeness, you should increase your allotment of ram to at least 4GB. You can also go whole-hog and up the memory to 8GB.

### 2. Using Yarn

``` bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Copy the .env.example file to .env
# @todo: is this actually needed?
cp .env.example .env

# Serve the frontend with hot reload at localhost:3000
yarn dev

# Run linting
yarn lint

# Run end to end tests
yarn test --config=./codecept.local.json
```

Essential Development .env Variables
------------------------------------

```yaml
# REQUIRED
CONSUMER_ID: Use the UUID for the poets.org user in /admin/config/services/consumer.
API_URL: You may want to replace the default yakbak URL with the DRUPAL_URL value.

# IF YOU WANT TO LOGIN, HINT: YOU PROBABLY DO
ONEALL_SUBDOMAIN=poets
ONEALL_PRIVATE_KEY=
ONEALL_PUBLIC_KEY=

# IF YOU WANT TWITTER THINGS
TWIT_CONSUMER_KEY=
TWIT_CONSUMER_SECRET=
TWIT_ACCESS_TOKEN=
TWIT_TOKEN_SECRET=
```

Building for Production
-----------------------

You can also do this via `lando yarn` but makes more sense to use `yarn` straight up. See the `.platform.app.yaml` for the actual production build and deployment steps.

Checking Logs on Production
---------------------------
To check the logs on the production environment, you can run:
```
PM2_HOME=/app/run pm2 logs prod
```
